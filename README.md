A repository filled with codewars challeges (kata). Challeges are pushed every day.
How It's Made:
Tech used: Javascript

Everyday, I do a coding challege to get the brain up and going!

Optimizations:
After solving the inital challege I go back and refactor my code for readability and efficiency.

Lessons Learned:

One of the biggest thing I've learned doing this is to not get discouraged when faced with a question I don't know, I just need to take a step back 
and really think about it. Sometimes the answer is the most simple and I've just overcomplicated it.
